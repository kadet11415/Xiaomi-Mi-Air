# Undervolting CPU
After you have unlocked the CPU core voltage [HOWTO](https://github.com/johnnync13/Xiaomi-Mi-Air/tree/master/BIOS) you can undervolt the CPU using the script `mpcpu.sh`. This results in lower power usage (longer battery life) and cooler CPU temperatures.

1. Run the script
```
bash mpcpu.sh
```
2. Run the install command (1)
3. Default power setting is recommended (2). Use the others at your own risk!
4. 0.09V undervolting should work (1)
5. Test using the temporary settings. If it works, you can install the script permanently.

Enjoy your cooler laptop under macOS!
